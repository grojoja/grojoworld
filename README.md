Engine constructed worlds in a grid layout, comprised of individual tiles, each with unique properties and aesthetics.
Incorporated overhead perspective for immersive user experience, similar to classic games like "Zelda II" on the NES.

**Key Responsibilities:**

Designed and programmed the core engine in Java, focusing on efficient world generation and tile management.
Implemented a variety of interactive elements, including NPCs, objects, and environmental features, enhancing the exploration experience.
Engineered a user interface that allowed players to navigate and interact seamlessly within the game world.
Collaborated with a team of designers and artists to ensure a visually appealing and engaging environment.

**Achievements:**

Successfully balanced memory and performance constraints to ensure smooth gameplay on target platforms.
Adapted and extended traditional tile-based mechanics to create a unique and engaging exploration experience.
Received positive feedback from user testing, highlighting the engine's intuitiveness and the world's immersive quality.
